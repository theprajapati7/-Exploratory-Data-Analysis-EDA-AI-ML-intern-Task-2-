# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

This project performs exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the data through statistical summaries and visualizations. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns that could be useful for further modeling or analysis.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- The dataset contains information about passengers including features like age, fare, class, gender, and survival status.

## 📌 Objectives

- Generate summary statistics for numerical features.
- Visualize distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Explore relationships between features using pairplots and correlation matrices.
- Identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
- Make basic feature-level inferences based on visualizations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading and Overview**  
   - Load and inspect the dataset structure and missing values.

2. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, range, etc.

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Histograms and boxplots for numeric features  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Pairplots for feature relationships

4. **Insights & Inferences**  
   - Identify skewness, outliers, and class-based differences  
   - Interpret visual patterns to understand key features

## 📄 Report

All insights and visualizations are documented within the Jupyter Notebook file (`EDA_Titanic.ipynb`) under each respective step.

## 🔍 Sample Insights

- `Fare` is highly right-skewed with outliers in the higher range.
- Passengers in Pclass 1 paid significantly higher fares.
- Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
- Weak correlation between age and fare.
